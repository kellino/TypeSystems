My attempt to work through the various type systems as detailed in Pierce's **Types and Programming
Languages**.

Doubtless of **zero** interest to anyone else but me, this *wip* is just for my own practice. Check
again in 5 years time to see it finished.

I've experimented with various libraries and approaches here, so please do not look at this as the best (or even a good)
way of implementing any of these type systems: the code style is **not** consistent!
